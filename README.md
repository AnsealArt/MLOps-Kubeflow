# MLOps-Kubeflow
<br />
This repository shows simple MLOps-based ML Pipelines implementations on [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow):

* Breast Cancer Type Classification problem (using 3 different classification algorithms)  
* California Housing Price Prediction (using SGD Regressor)

<br /><hr><br />

These are sample problems that may be used as a ML-solvable problems for any purpose. <br />
To make machine learning more scalable and reliable it is not only a model creation, but also creation of whole MLOps Pipeline that allows us to:
* Track Artifacts
* Reuse components
* Scale every step of the Pipeline
* Monitor and visualize everything we need to
* Productionalize and Operationalize machine learning
* and many more

Kubeflow gives us a possibility of using an MLOps-prepared software based on Kubernetes, for best practices embracement.
