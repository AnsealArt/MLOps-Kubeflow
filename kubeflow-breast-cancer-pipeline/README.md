<hr>

## The goal
The idea behind classification is to train ML model to classify cases to one of two possibilities: Malignant or Benign cancer type.

<hr>

## Metadata
* Number of cases: 569
* Number of attributes: 30

<hr>

## Attributes
Attribute Information:

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

1. radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
2. texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
3. perimeter
4. area
5. smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
6. compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
7. concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
8. concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
9. symmetry
10. fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
